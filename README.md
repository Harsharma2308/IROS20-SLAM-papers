# IROS20-SLAM-papers

### The paper list 
- http://bit.ly/iros20-slam-papers

### Note
- This is a personal [list-up](http://bit.ly/iros20-slam-papers): 
  - SLAM-related papers are collected as many as possible (almost all), and I applied my own taxonomy (would be ambiguous).
  - Path planning papers are not fully collected (just partial papers for my interest).
  - and papers about 3D deep learning for robotics also included.  
- Currently, summaries partially exist for some papers (but will be added for others).
